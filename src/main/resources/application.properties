# ================== Error Handling Configuration (Development Recommended) ==================
# Include the error message in the response body (useful for debugging)
server.error.include-message=always

# Include detailed validation and binding errors (e.g., @Valid errors)
server.error.include-binding-errors=always

# Include the exception class name in the response (safe for development, not recommended for production)
server.error.include-exception=true

# Include the stack trace:
# - never      : never include stack trace
# - on_param   : include only when ?trace=true is added in the request
# on_param is safer for development; production should use "never"
server.error.include-stacktrace=on_param
